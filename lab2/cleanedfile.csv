FAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.

SYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.

SECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. 

100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. 

POWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.

RELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. 

FUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.

SIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.

PRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.

INTRODUCING NEW LOOKS AND BORDERS:

CREATIVE LOOKS:

CORRECTIONS:

Make your photos pop with simple sliders:

Use these controls in your photos to produce stunning results. 
Contrast is an attention-grabbing control that can turn your ordinary photo into a dazzling masterpiece.
Adjust the color saturation using the Vibrance and Saturation controls.
Adjust clarity slider to reveal more texture and detail in your photos.
Use the Dehaze slider to add or remove haze from your photo.

* Exposure, highlights, shadows, blacks and whites
You can fine-tune the photo’s exposure setting using the Exposure adjustment controls. Highlights and Shadows are the best way to optimize your photo’s exposure in highlights, midtones, and shadows, without compromising on other areas of tonality.
Use Blacks and Whites to set black point and white point of the photo. This makes colors appear completely black or white.

* Temperature and Tint
Use Temperature and Tint controls to introduce warmth or coldness to your photo. You can also control the amount of green and red tones in your photo.
Use the Temperature slider controls to increase or decrease the amount of orange or blue tone. Increasing the amount of orange introduces warmth to your photo. Increasing the amount of blue introduces coldness to your photo.
Use the Tint slider control to add more red or green tone to your photo. Auto White-Balance does this automatically for you.

* Details
Use Sharpen, Reduce Luminance Noise, and Reduce Color Noise to make photos look more beautiful and minimize unwanted grain and speckling in your photos.

* Split Tone
Stylize your photos through color tints in the highlights and shadows.

* Blur
Use the Blur effect to give your images an enhanced, surreal effect.

* Fade
Blend images with the background using the new “Fade” effect and give a matte feel to your photos.

*Vignette Effect
Add a sentimental feeling or evoke nostalgia to your images using the Vignette effect.

SPOT HEAL
* Removing spots or blemishes have never been so easy! Remove pimples, scars, dirt and dust from your photos with one touch.

Net Speed Meter,Free,"A desktop meter that reveals the download and the upload speed of your Internet connection in real time, also running in the system tray

Windows does not feature an integrated tool for monitoring the upload and the download speeds of your Internet connection. This is the reason why many developers created simple yet handy software utilities designed to help you keep an eye on such important network-related parameters. One example is Net Speed Meter.

This particular application is one of those tiny software programs that fulfill a simple task but can prove quite useful. Once you run it, a small meter is shown on your desktop, similar to what were once the Windows gadgets.



Runs in the system tray as well 

The first instinct is to right-click and double-click on the meter to see if any menu pops up. Actually, you will be surprised to see that the meter simply disappears. If you navigate to the system tray, you will notice that Net Speed Meter’s icon is also there. The application runs in the background and gets minimized when double-clicking it. To get the meter back on the desktop, you simply have to double-click the tray icon or choose to maximize it from the context menu.

Another consequence of a double-click on the meter is that the current download or the upload speed is copied to the clipboard automatically, so you can easily paste it anywhere you need to.
Alter the meter’s appearance with ease 

The right-click menu in the system tray enables you to access the application’s settings and customize its behavior. There are just a few things to deal with here. For instance, you can change the speed unit from bits per second  to bytes per second. Additionally, the appearance of the meter, which is black by default, can be altered from the Settings window. The font and the text size can also be changed.

Net Speed Meter can be configured to start with Windows, so that you don’t start it manually each time you open your computer.
Monitor the upload and the download speeds 

Net Speed Meter displays information regarding the Internet connection speed in plain sight, on your desktop. The meter is set to stay on top of all the other opened windows so that you don’t lose sight of the upload and download speeds.",Zero Byte,21-11-2019,Utilities & tools,6.47 MB,For ages 3 and up,English(UnitedStates)

Web VPN,Free,"Web VPN is free proxy service that unblocks sites and connects to the US proxy server. 

You may not know it (and once you do not know it, it may not bother you), but every time you reach out to a website or connect with anyone online, your online connection gives your computer ""address"" to the site/person you're connecting with.

Why? So that you the other end knows how to send information (a Web page, email, etc.) back to your computer...to you. That address is your public IP address. IP stands for Internet Protocol. Want to see yours right now? Just go here to our home page and it will be there.

Without an IP address, you wouldn't be able to do any Internet/online activity and others online wouldn't be able to reach you. It is how you connect to the world.

Where does your IP address come from?
You can thank your Internet Service Provider (AT&T, Comcast, Verizon, etc.) for your IP address at home, as well as for your Internet connection. Your smart device also uses an IP address when you're browsing the web or using an app.

Most people are completely happy with how all of that works.

But there are few realities about public IP addresses that does bother some people:

Your IP address identifies where you are in the world, sometimes to the street level.

It can be used by websites to block you from accessing their content.
It ultimately ties your name and home address to your IP address, because someone is paying for an Internet connection at a specific location.

But there are a few ways you can get around those realities, and one them is to use a proxy service or proxy server (people simply say ""proxy."")

A proxy server acts as a gateway between you and the internet. It's an intermediary server separating end users from the websites they browse.

Free proxy can be a great alternative to a free VPN if you don't need protection on the operating system level.",Roob,30-04-2020,Productivity,6.3 MB,For ages 3 and up,English(UnitedStates)

Cinebench,Free,"How powerful is your computer? Test it with Cinebench!

Cinebench leverages the same powerful 3D engine found in the award-winning animation software Cinema 4D Release 23 to accurately evaluate CPU rendering performance capabilities across various systems and platforms. 

For over a decade, Cinebench has been a popular tool to evaluate hardware performance. Cinebench scores are used by system administrators to help make purchase decisions, journalists to review hardware, hardware manufacturers to optimize their latest products, as well as computer owners to evaluate their individual system. 

Improvements to Cinebench Release 23 reflect the overall advancements to CPU and rendering technology in recent years, providing a more accurate measurement of Cinema 4D's ability to take advantage of multiple CPU cores and modern processor features available to the average user.

Cinebench R23 FAQs:

• Cinebench R23 supports Apple’s ARM-powered silicon computing systems.

• Cinebench R23 is now based on the latest Cinema 4D Release 23 code using updated compilers, and has a minimum runtime activated by default (previously hidden in preferences).

• Cinebench R23 provides improved benchmark accuracy for current and next generation CPUs to test if a machine runs stable on a high CPU load, if the cooling solution of a desktop or notebook is sufficient for longer running tasks to deliver the full potential of the CPU, and if a machine is able to handle demanding real-life 3D tasks.

• Cinebench R23 now has the option to directly test the single core performance without manually enabling the “Advanced benchmark” option. The “Advanced benchmark” allows users to set arbitrary minimum runtimes to stress test the hardware for even longer periods of time.
Because of code and compiler changes, Cinebench R23 score values are readjusted to a new range so they should not be compared to scores from previous versions of Cinebench

• Cinebench R23 does not test GPU performance.

• Cinebench R23 will not launch on unsupported processors. On systems lacking sufficient RAM to load the test scene, a warning will be displayed, and the CPU benchmark will not be executed.

• Background tasks can significantly influence measurement and create diverse results. It's always a good idea to shut down all running programs and disable any virus checking or disk indexing, but it's impossible to eliminate all background processes. Modern operating systems perform various background tasks that cannot or should not be disabled, even though they could have a minor influence on the results.

• Test results can vary slightly because it's impossible to disable every background task of the operating system. These tasks are one factor that may have a slight influence on measurements. Also, modern computers and graphics cards dynamically adjust clock speeds based on environmental conditions like power and temperature. For instance, processors will reduce clock speed when running too hot to allow for cooling and prevent damage. With many modern processors the reverse is also true. They are able to overclock themselves when the temperature is low enough. So, a system freshly started in a relatively cool environment will typically run faster than the same system that has been performing benchmarks for several hours in a heated office.",MAXON Computer GmbH,18-10-2018,Productivity,643.03 MB,For ages 3 and up,English(UnitedStates)

RoundedTB,Free,"Add margins, rounded corners and segments to your taskbars! With RoundedTB, you can customise the shape and appearance of Windows' taskbar, without modifying any system files or making any permanent system changes.

BASIC OPTIONS
The simplest way to use RoundedTB is by simply entering a margin and corner radius. RoundedTB lives in the system tray, just right-click its icon to access all the settings.

 - Margin - controls how many pixels to remove from each side of the taskbar, creating a margin around it that you can see and click through.

 - Corner Radius - adjusts how round the corners of the taskbar should be.

 - Advanced - displays a host of additional advanced customisation options, explained below.

 - Apply - applies the selected settings to the taskbar. 



ADVANCED OPTIONS
These allow for further customisation, at the cost of some user-friendliness.

 - Independent Margins - in the advanced settings, a [...] button appears on the margin box. Click it to enable independent margins, which allow you to specify the margin for each side of the taskbar. You can also use negative values to hide the rounded corners for some sides, allowing you to ""attach"" the taskbar to different sides of the monitor.

 - Dynamic Mode (Windows 11) - dynamic mode automatically resizes the taskbars to accommodate the number of icons in it, making the taskbar behave similarly to macOS' Dock.

 - Split Mode (Windows 10) - split mode is a simplified version of dynamic mode for Windows 10. Due to a more limited taskbar, dynamically resizing the taskbar isn't possible. However after some setup (enable this option for more info), split mode allows you to separate the taskbar from the system tray and resize it at will. I admit it's certainly not as cool as dynamic mode, but for now it's better than nothing 🥺

 - Show System Tray - this toggles whether or not the system tray, clock etc. is displayed in dynamic/split mode. It can be toggled at any time by pressing [Win]+[F2].

 - TranslucentTB Compatibility - I've worked closely with Sylveon to enable some level of compatibility between TranslucentTB and RoundedTB. This is experimental and will flicker slightly, and requires TranslucentTB version 2021.5 to function. For more info, enable this option.

 - About RoundedTB - provides information about the current version of RoundedTB. The ""Debug"" section lets you open the config and log files.



KNOWN ISSUES
I'm working to fix these where possible, but for now it's worth being aware of them. If these are dealbreakers, then check back in the future and hopefully I'll have sorted them!

 - When initially enabling dynamic mode with centred taskbar icons, the taskbar may stretch to the left. If this happens, just set the taskbar to left-aligned then back to the centre once and it should be fixed.

 - Auto-hiding is still incredibly experimental and may lead to a lot of flickering, especially with TranslucentTB compatibility or dynamic/split mode enabled.

 - Rounded corners are not antialiased due to a Windows limitation.

 - Dynamic mode/split mode only work correctly when the taskbar is horizontal at the top/bottom of the screen.

 - Split mode on Windows 10 only supports the main taskbar, secondary taskbars will not be split.

 - When using dynamic mode, the taskbar may occasionally become too large, too small or not update. This can usually be fixed by moving a window to or from that monitor, or briefly changing the taskbar alignment.

 - Compatibility with taskbar mods outside of TranslucentTB version 2021.5 is not currently guaranteed.



NOTE
RoundedTB is still in development, there are still bugs (see above!) If you encounter anything not listed above, let me know on GitHub or the Discord server linked there otherwise I can't fix them (see the Support link at the bottom of the Store page). Features marked as [Preview] are even earlier in development and have some known issues, so use at your own risk. To disable completely, Close RTB, uninstall it, then restart Explorer or your PC.",TorchGM,01-06-2021,Personalization,8.83 MB,For ages 3 and up,English(UnitedStates)

Pure instant messaging — simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices. Over 400 million active users.


FAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.


SYNCED: You can access your messages from all your devices at once. Start typing on your phone and finish the message from your tablet or laptop. Never lose your data again.


UNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it.


SECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange.


POWERFUL: You can create group chats for up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.), and even set up bots for specific tasks. It's the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.


RELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages in the minimum bytes possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections.


FUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.


SIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we are taking great care to keep the interface clean. With its minimalist design, Telegram is lean and easy to use.


100% FREE & NO ADS: Telegram is free and will always be free. We are not going to sell ads or introduce subscription fees.


PRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give third parties access to your data.


For those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use end-to-end encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.


We keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.","Unigram, Inc.",23-03-2017,Social,94.03 MB,For ages 12 and up,"English(UnitedStates)   العربية(المملكةالعربيةالسعودية)   Беларуская(Беларусь)   Català(Català)   Deutsch(Deutschland)   Español(España,AlfabetizaciónInternacional)   فارسى(ایران)   Français(France)   Indonesia(Indonesia)   Italiano(Italia)   한국어(대한민국)   BahasaMelayu(Malaysia)   Nederlands(Nederland)   Polski(Polska)   Português(Brasil)   Русский(Россия)   Türkçe(Türkiye)   Українська(Україна)"

What is Notepads and why do I care?

I have been waiting long enough for a modern Windows 10 notepad app to come before I decided to create one myself. Don’t get me wrong, Notepad++, VS Code, and Sublime are great text editors. I have used them all and I will continue to use them in the future. However, they are either too heavy or looks less appealing. There are times that I just wanted to use Windows notepad for things like writing notes or editing config files. So I decided to create a win32 notepad replacement here and try to give it a modern look and feel. Most importantly, it has to be blazingly fast and appeal to everyone.

Notepads is still under active development.

With the help of Photo Resizer you can compress, resize, shrink, grow and crop your photos, images and pictures for free. 

You can use Photo Resizer to resize photos and images on your phone, on a variety of different situations, for example:
- Sending/sharing photos to your family and friends
- Save space on phone by shrinking then to optimum size
- Overcome Size limits for Emailing photos
- Publishing images on your website to make sure pages load fast sending images as email attachments
- Posting photos on blog
- Posting photos on Facebook, Google+ and other social media creating internet auction pages, such as eBay, webstore, OnlineAuction, OZtion, WeBidz, uBid, Allegro posting photos on forum
- Including pictures within word or PDF documents


When you send the e-mail with attached pictures, you will often find that the e-mail exceeds the message size limit. For example, if your email account allows you to send messages up to 5 megabytes (MB) and you include just two pictures in the attachment (today’s pictures taken by a phone or tablet camera are about 3 or 4 MB), you will probably exceed the maximum message size. In this case, this image resize app is very helpful, because it helps to avoid exceeding the maximum message size limits associated with most email accounts. Resize pictures before composing the e-mail and then attach much smaller pictures.

We asked, you answered. You're tired of our 'old, boring, corporate-looking' Graphics Control Panel. We were too and we designed a completely new one from the ground up! We’re incorporating the changes you – the gamers, home theater enthusiasts, professionals, and everyday tinkerers requested. Using a phased approach, we're rolling out something we're proud to share with you: introducing the Intel® Graphics Command Center.

You told us how confusing ‘tongue twister’ features like tessellation and anisotropic filtering can be to understand, so we created a robust help option tailored to simplifying it all. Take all the guess work out of game and media tuning with visual guidance on what each feature does, and how it impacts your experience.

We’re really just getting started. We'll be introducing many more features and functions in later phases and will keep the improvements coming, to give you the best possible experience we can. Please check it out and remember to let us know what you think. We recommend updating your Intel graphics driver to the latest version, which you can get Intel's website.

• If you bought a new PC running Windows, the product key will be pre–installed on your PC and the key will be included in the firmware in the case of Windows 8 or 10 - or as an OEM marker, in the case of previous versions. The OEM key will display the key in the case of the former, or whether your PC was built for Windows Vista or Windows 7.

NOTICE
Currently it uses simple UI, you can custom panel buttons. Since it's still under development, functions can change (add/remove, FFmpeg DLL may update and change) at any time.  And currently I won't add more languages(hard to maintain).
This app is just a lite player, I do not write decoder, it uses system(sdk component) and free FFmpeg(unmodifiable, under LGPL) to decode data automatically.  I think it should support system player default formats, but I don't know how many does FFmpeg(WinRT) support. It should support most common formats, but it will not support all formats, just try, if not supported, I can do nothing to it. . The target of the app is to show my new tech & features for media playback, not to support as many formats as possible. Thanks.

Tumblr,Free,"11-Time Webby Award Winner: Best Community 

Tumblr. An effervescent pocket of pure internet culture. The subtle experience. An ecosystem of posting what you make, sharing what you love, and scrolling through all that lies in between memes, text, music, and tweets. Post pictures of your pet snake, delve into dank memes, find fellow fans, match your reality to your mood in a GIF. Add to it or simply scroll through and soak it up. 

Now picture all of the above, but on the go. That’s what this is. Watch as a community grows around you, led by ideas, aesthetics, initiatives—instead of individuals. Come as you are, curl up with whatever brings you to your dash in the first place. The rest will layer up like your favorite outfit in fall. Watch as your likes and reblogs fashion a feed that you will love while whatever you’re posting will float through your followers’ feeds. 

Oh, and the algorithm? Doesn’t even go here. Every video you find, every quote you reblog, every tag you curate, every waterfall GIF you secretly gaze at in wonder—that’s all you. You’re the explorer. We’re just a map you all keep on making. Go wherever you want. 

So. Whether you’re a complete innocent searching for images of bullet journals bathed in natural light, or a rookie puppy parent in need of support, or you suddenly interrupt your knitting blog to satisfy a new urge to collect marine biology memes that may or may not exist yet—you’ll find what you’re looking for.

MetaMoJi ClassRoom provides an interactive teaching environment for individual study, group study, and collaborative learning.  As a social learning platform, Share for Classroom allows teachers to digitally guide student work progress in real-time online interaction. The app provides teachers with a virtual whiteboard canvas to customize highly visual lesson plans including drawing, handwriting, images, websites, even audio and video files.  

As students work through the lesson plans, teachers can monitor their progress with a virtual look over the shoulder.  Since all results of document markup are displayed in real-time, student engagement in lesson plans can become highly interactive. For distance learning situations, the cloud-based streaming environment provides an ideal way for instructor and student to work closer together.  All work is displayed as it is entered in real-time, making it easier to illustrate and share lessons and ideas.

MetaMoJi ClassRoom allows teachers to distribute a “Class Note” to their students. The note is either created from scratch with the powerful tools within the app or by importing files from PDF or Microsoft Office formats. Opening the Class Note starts a class. The students can write answers, sketch drawings or import photos and graphics to illustrate their ideas.  Teachers can monitor how each student or group is progressing through the lesson. Easy management controls even allow the teacher to pass presentation control to the student to demonstrate their work.

Following the lesson presented in class, students can join collaborative study groups and work through their homework together by checking in to the same document and sharing ideas within it.   Teachers can used the platform for wraparound tutoring opportunities, helping students individually or in a group in virtual sessions. Teachers can even run an interactive lecture with their remote students.

Performance Index 64 - CPU Benchmark chart for your PC,Free,"The Performance Index 64 app is designed to compare your PC with macOS devices and evaluate performance and efficiency of different platforms and configurations.

Since we are talking about a 64-bit system, we took the very first 64-bit computer designed by Apple as a conventional unit - the legendary Power Mac G5 first introduced by Steve Jobs in June 2003.

Powered by the PowerPC processors, the Power Mac G5 was so effective and energy efficient that in autumn 2003 a group of enthusiastic students introduced the System X supercomputer, combined with 1100 of such desktops. This supercomputer became a real technological breakthrough, taking third place in the TOP-500 rating.

Nowadays, such a result would be impossible. If we would have combined a similar configuration of 1100 top 64-bit desktops, the resulting supercomputer wouldn’t even be included in the TOP-100 of the world ranking.

With the help of our application you can find out how much of the legendary Power Mac G5 your PC contains. Also you can compare your PC with the powerful Mac Pro powered by Intel.
